Cairo University Eco-Racing team applies every year for the Shell Eco-Racing 2023 Marathon competition,
so it aims to create an autonomous car, by creating an embedded control system that controls the ICE
(internal combustion engine) vehicle, and this system contains roughly the following:

1. One DC motor to control the speed of wheels.
2. One stepper motor to move the wheels angle right and left.
3. A decision-maker unit (out of scope) which sends its decisions to our micro-controller.
4. A dashboard to show out the current state and the car parameters, that are always up to date.

This task will focus on your coding skills in writing efficient, clean and robust embedded-c code, and your
ability to integrate multiple blocks that work in harmony in a single design.
